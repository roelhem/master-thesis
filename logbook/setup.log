Setting up the workspace for the thesis project.

I try to make and structure a single Git-repository (or something similar)
that contains everything I will write during the thesis project. It has the
following requirements:
  1. Allow for simple version control (Probably just one branch. Mainly to
     ensure that nothing gets lost if anything goes wrong.)
  2. Allow me to quickly start a new working environment on any computer.
     This because I don't have a laptop and it is possible that I will work
     on my thesis at my office and on the UU.
  3. Allow the supervisor(s) to access my ongoing work quickly.
  4. (At the end of the project.) Have a nice way show of my working style
     to future employers.

I would also like to have some helper-scripts to automate the annoying parts of
book-keeping, mainly to counteract my chaotic nature. This usually prevents me
to make mistakes in the bookkeeping part of writing a thesis, which can safe
me a lot of time.

I also start at the preperation of structure of the bibliography. I use the
structure following PhD. thesis as an example:
https://github.com/basnijholt/thesis

I make some README.md files to document the choices I make for the structure
of the project.

Continue setting up the structure.

Setting up Python and Haskell environments.

Making the init.sh script to quickly setup the whole project.

Try to make something in Haskell to refresh my memory. (Mainly the automatic
sources getter.)

Finishing the automatic source getter and publishing everything to github.
